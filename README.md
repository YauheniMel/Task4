# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To use the app, you must:

### Install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Create MySQL database and create .env file according to .env.example file

# Dev mode:

### run server:
```
npm run server:dev
```
### run react app:
```
npm run start
```

# Prod mode:

### build server (dist folder will be created):
```
npm run server:build
```
### build react app (build folder will be created):
```
npm run build
```
### run server:
```
npm run server
```
### run react app:
```
serve -s build
```

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
